# ChurnPrediction

Project Motivation: Users often unsubscribe from a platform after certain period of time. There could be multiple reasons for the same ranging from pricing issues, to quality of the services. It is a huge problem for the companies to understand pleothra of reasons for a users downgrade. So its benificial to understand in advance which users are most likely to churn. Then company can identify key features and improve the service
Here, we will be working with a subset(128 Mb) of main(12 Gb) dataset using PySpark and ML. The smaller dataset being scalable to big data platform of Apache Spark.

Files :
The repo consists of:
Jupyter Notebook: Sparkify.ipynb
The note book covers Data Cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Feature Engineering and finally Machine Learning Modeling.
